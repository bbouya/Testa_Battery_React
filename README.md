# Testa_Battery_React

Almost all React application UIs consist of a composition of components. For example, a weather app consists of a component that displays a local name, a component that displays the current temperature, and a graph component that represents a five-day forecast. For this reason, it is a good idea to decompose the UI into component units before developing the React app.

# The layout of this application is shown below

1.3.1 Container and Presentational Components
In the above mentioned component tree, we can see that it is classified as Container Component and Presentational Component.

This is a useful pattern that can be used when developing an application with React. It is easier to reuse by dividing components into two categories.

* Container Component (stateful component):
 - Are concerned with how things work.
 - In general, except for some wrapping divs, they do not have their   own DOM markup and have no style.
 - Provide data and actions to presentational or other container components.
 - Are often stateful, as they tend to serve as data sources.
 
* Presentational Component (stateless component):
 - Are concerned with how things look.
 - Usually have some DOM markup and styles of their own.
 - Receive data and callbacks exclusively via props.
 - Rarely have their own state (when they do, itâ€™s UI state rather than data).


 ## TeslaBattery Container :
 In our app, the TeslaBattery component is responsible for creating and managing data and state as container component, passing it to other Presentational Components, Performing a callback function and changing its sate.
